# System-Design-Document
Collection of requirements from the customer and design of a system that meets those needs. 

This project was developed for a client known as 'Driver Pass' who wanted to improve the learning environment for a driver’s license. They wanted students to have the ability to schedule physical driving tests, learn information in an online class-based theme, practice taking tests/exams, and observe their overall progress and aptitude briefly. 

In this project I created a series of diagrams to help others understand the functionality of this system. I am quite proud of my sequence diagram given the limited amount of information for the scope of this project. I made some assumptions as to the development of the entire project to allow for my diagrams to feel somewhat legitimate. 

If given the time I would like to go back to my requirements and enhance them. I think my requirements involving infrastructure could use some work because I don't know as much about that sector as I would like to. If I knew more about the infrastructure of a system, I am sure that I could dramatically improve those requirements. 

I heavily reviewed the transcript between the user and our product owner to truly understand what the user wanted. I quickly understood that the user didn't have a solid idea for the look and feel of the system, but they knew what the student would need, and how they wanted to accomplish that. I took their foundation and designed a system that was extremely functional and true to what they needed while adding a few personal touches I believed help their system stand out. You must keep the users’ needs at the highest oof priorities because after all it is their system and their burden of costs to endure when finalized. 

As I touched on earlier, I approach the design of software quite directly at first, but then largely creative at the end. You must lay out all the groundwork and framing of a project to start. You need to ensure that your client’s requirements are all going to be met, and then you can start adding the finishing touches that make a system special and unique. An artist always starts with a canvas, a house starts with a foundation, all things have a means of being started just like software. It’s the work that is done after that phase that can make something standout.
